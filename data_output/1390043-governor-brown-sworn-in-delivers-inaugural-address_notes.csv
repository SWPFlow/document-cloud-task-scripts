The Central Valley and rural inland areas aren't recovering as fast as coastal California. And the poor and middle-class aren't feeling the recovery as much as other Californians are.

Now the question is WHAT Brown might choose to put that money towards. Observers say he may expedite the time it takes to fully finance the Local Control Funding Formula, the state's new system for funding public schools. Or he may decide to turn his attention to early education, and expand transitional kindergarten. Another option: Spending the money on innovative initiatives that do not require ongoing funding. -- Ana Tintocalis, KQED "

","The University of California and the California State University systems are calling for an end to long years of neglect and disinvestment, especially since K-12 education is seeing big funding increases. UC has already approved tuition increases over the next five years unless the state guarantees for money to the system. Brown has been reluctant to promise more money. Instead, he's suggesting offering more online classes, requiring faculty members to devote more time to teaching, instead of research, and curbing salaries for administrators and professors to increase access. -- Ana Tintocalis, KQED "

Brown is pointing to the expansion of the Medi-Cal program (called Medicaid nationally). Under the expansion allowed by the Affordable Care Act, people who earn up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level are now eligible for Medi-Cal. But with all the publicity around the expansion and the Affordable Care Act in general, many people signed up who were eligible before the Affordable Care Act went into effect. While the federal government is funding 100 percent of the cost of new enrollees, it continues to cover just 50 percent of people who have signed up now -- but were previously eligible.  These new enrollees -- some 800,000 people who signed up by March 31, 2014 -- are expected to cost the state $2.4 billion over two years. The state had estimated 509,000 people would sign up. Still more people are expected to enroll in Medi-Cal during 2015. Right now, 1 in 3 Californians are covered by Medi-Cal. -- Lisa Aliferis, KQED"

It has reduced its prison population by contracting beds in other facilities, diverting some inmates to local jails and allocating more credits for good behavior. Several propositions also modified laws which resulted in less people going to prison.

Independent energy analysts say key challenges for doing this statewide include how to manage more sources of power coming on and off the grid to minimize stress on the infrastructure and ""overgeneration,"" or production of far more energy than can be used at a given moment. According to a report by the consultants Energy and Environmental Economics, or EThree, 50% renewable energy could mean rate increases of between 9 to 23 percent over what they will be when a third of the state's energy comes from renewables. -- Molly Peterson, KPCC"

"1390043-governor-brown-sworn-in-delivers-inaugural-address","Governor Brown Sworn in Delivers Inaugural Address","5","Capital Public Radio","public","ECONOMY: The future of California","This final paragraph is the very crux of Gov. Brown's message today: Be bold, but be careful. Take risks, but pick which risks to take strategically. California has made many major changes in recent years - a new school funding formula, expanding Medi-Cal, criminal justice realignment - so the state should focus on making those programs a success, rather than taking on big new challenges. This is a clear message to legislative Democrats who want to invest the budget surplus by restoring some of the deepest recession-era cuts to health and social services programs. -- Ben Adler, Capital Public Radio"
