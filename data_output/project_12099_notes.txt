		* EDUCATION: With respect to higher education, cost pressures are relentless and many students cannot get the classes they need. A half million fewer students this year enrolled in the community colleges than in 2008
			* Nearly half a million community college students starting school this fall are on wait lists to get into classes, according to a new survey being released by the state. It offers a snapshot of the growing challenges California residents face in getting a degree. Community college enrollment numbers were also announced today. Enrollment dropped to 2.4 million. About half a million students have been lost in the community college system since the 2008-2009 school year's budget cuts.

		* BUDGET: Brown touts California's turnaround
			* When Brown delivered his first State of the State address of his current term in 2011, he warned that California faced a "crisis that is real and unprecedented." Since then the state's gaping deficits have turned into a $4 billion surplus, due to a combination of spending cuts, tax increases and - more importantly - an improving economy. Brown touted that turnaround, while warning lawmakers to avoid a future deficits by remaining conservative in spending new money.

		* THE SPEECH: What wasn't addressed in the State of the State
			* Perhaps the most remarkable part of Gov. Jerry Brown's 2014 State of the State address was its <a href="&lt;a%20href=">lack of a major policy proposal</a>.  Last year, for example, the governor proposed an overhaul of the state's school funding formula.  He also only obliquely referenced his two large - and controversial - infrastructure projects: the twin tunnels underneath the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta that would transport water to Central and Southern California, and the high-speed rail project from San Francisco to Los Angeles.

		* BUDGET: Brown lays out the hundreds of billions of dollars California needs to pay in future years. 
			* These long-term liabilities - particularly the more than $100 billion the state owes in future pension obligations - are a major reason Brown is urging lawmakers to be cautious with the extra money the state is bringing in this year. He wants to pay off $11 billion in debt in this year's budget. But importantly, Brown has yet to put forward any specific plan to pay off this massive debt.
<br>
-- Scott Detrow, KQED, <a href="https://twitter.com/scottdetrow">@scottdetrow</a> 
<br><br>
 In fact, the governor has said he won't try to address the roughly $355 billion in unfunded liabilities this year at all. Instead, he's called for a discussion with stakeholders, with action to come in 2015 - meaning he's choosing not to take this issue on as he runs for re-election this year.

Health and human services spending is a big part of the California budget, making up more than a quarter of the proposed general fund expenditures for 2014-2015. Its not surprising that one of few mentions the Governor made about health care in this years state of the state is about long term spending on care. <a href="http://www.capradio.org/articles/2014/01/22/brown-speech-touts-bioscience,-warns-of-future-health-care-costs/">Read why one UCSF School of Nursing medical economist</a> says the governor is right to urge fiscal prudence.

<br>

The governor actually ad-libbed this portion, and said the following: "I have some playing cards here that puts the chart thats in the budget summary of the last 15 years. You probably cant see this, but its mostly red  with a little black in the beginning and the end. But just not to discourage you, and lift your spirits, I put something on the back of this playing card: a picture of Sutter, and underneath  well, on this side, we have the quote from George Santayana  dont forget, you know, those who forget the past will repeat it On this side, Sutter makes a number of little comments.

		* BUDGET: Rainy day fund a key part of Brown's budget plan
			* A key component of Brown's 2014-2015 budget is a constitutional amendment that would set aside excess tax revenue for deficit years. Here's a <a href="http://lat.ms/1fcuzZf">Los Angeles Times article</a> on the proposal.

The idea is to smooth out what is typically the most volatile aspect of California's tax revenues: capital gains returns. When the stock market booms, like it did in 2013, California banks billions of dollars in unexpected tax returns. But when the market goes south, those  funds quickly disappear. That's because the top one percent of income earners - people who primarily make money off of investments -- account for more than 40 percent of California's income tax revenue. 

Brown's plan, initially proposed by Speaker John Perez, would automatically send capital gains revenue over a certain amount to a rainy day fund. It would replace a rainy day fund plan already on the fall ballot that most lawmakers don't like.

A major deadline in that ongoing battle looms: tomorrow, the state and lawyers representing prisoners must submit dueling plans for how to reduce the population total to the amount mandated by several court rulings. The judges will make a final recommendation later this year. This comes after negotiations between the two sides broke down, despite several deadline extensions granted by the judges.

			* California has a mandate to cut its greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels within 6 years, as a result of AB 32 and other key laws. Governor Brown points out that California is hugely dependent on gasoline and other fossil fuels, the combustion of which contributes to smog and particulate air pollution, and worsen the effects of climate change. A cornerstone of the state's efforts to cut carbon is the state's nascent cap-and-trade system or "carbon market." Proceeds from the sale of pollution credits on this market total $850 million in this year's budget, and <a href="http://www.scpr.org/blogs/environment/2014/01/09/15571/green-is-good-as-governor-brown-s-budget-proposal/">much of that money will pay for</a> alternative fuel transportation, high speed rail, and pollution mitigation in low-income neighborhoods.

			* Here Gov. Brown is pointing to the expansion of the Medi-Cal program (called Medicaid nationally). Under the expansion allowed by the Affordable Care Act, people who earn up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level are now eligible for Medi-Cal. But with all the publicity around the expansion and the Affordable Care Act in general, many people signed up who were eligible before the Affordable Care Act went into effect. While the federal government is funding 100 percent of the cost of new enrollees, it continues to cover just 50 percent of people who have signed up now -- but were previously eligible.  These new enrollees -- some 800,000 people who signed up by March 31, 2014 -- are expected to cost the state $2.4 billion over two years. The state had estimated 509,000 people would sign up. Still more people are expected to enroll in Medi-Cal during 2015. Right now, 1 in 3 Californians are covered by Medi-Cal. -- Lisa Aliferis, KQED

Independent energy analysts say key challenges for doing this statewide include how to manage more sources of power coming on and off the grid to minimize stress on the infrastructure and "overgeneration," or production of far more energy than can be used at a given moment. According to a report by the consultants Energy and Environmental Economics, or EThree, 50% renewable energy could mean rate increases of between 9 to 23 percent over what they will be when a third of the state's energy comes from renewables. -- Molly Peterson, KPCC

California has made many major changes in recent years - a new school funding formula, expanding Medi-Cal, criminal justice realignment - so the state should focus on making those programs a success, rather than taking on big new challenges.
