document-cloud-task-scripts
===========================

## Overview

This is a collection of task-oriented *(aka spaghetti'd)* Python scripts I wrote to leverage [python-documentcloud wrapper](https://github.com/datadesk/python-documentcloud) written by the [Los Angeles Times Data Desk](https://github.com/datadesk) and [Ben Welsh](https://github.com/palewire) and perform batch and speciality tasks on [DocumentCloud](https://www.documentcloud.org/) files.

The documentation for python-documentcloud wrapper is top-notch, and you could use most of the methods contained in the library via the python shell. I've always liked to create re-usable scripts, and so here are some.
